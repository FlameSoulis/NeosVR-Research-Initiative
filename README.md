# The NeosVR Research Initiative
## The Goal
The NeosVR Research Inititavie is a project that aims to analyze and study the situation that has led to the current state of affairs of NeosVR in a scientific unbiased way.

This is to paint a sharper picture of what caused the current state, what the relations are between the different parties are for in the interest of the NeosVR project itself.

All collected data will be verified and become verifiable for everyone.

## The tools
In order to maximize efficiency we employ the use of the following tools:
- https://obsidian.md/
	- Obsidian is a markdown knowledge base tool that we use for cataloging data, this aims to make the information more accesible during the research/investigation phase of the project
- https://www.maltego.com/product-features/
	- Maltego is an opensource intelligence and graphical link analysis tool, which will aid in estabelishing data with certain relations, this tool is merely a supplement to the inforrmation documented trough Obsidian

Obsidian will not be required to analyze the data since it will all be stored in markdown format, tho it will be a lot easier to interpret the data using this tool:
![Obsidian in Action](https://github.com/JeroenMathon/NeosVR-Research-Initiative/raw/main/readme_screenshot.png)

For maltego, PDF renders of the documents will be provided in the repository making the data accesible for any party interested

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute data, trough merge requests data can be added to this repository, all submitted data must be verifiable and must contain instructions to do so.

We are also looking for people that have pragmatic analysis skills that possess a unbiased position in the conflict, this is to maintain the integrity of this scientific project.
