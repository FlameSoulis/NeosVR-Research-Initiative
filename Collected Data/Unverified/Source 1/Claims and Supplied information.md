1.  Unknown previous times Karel accued Geenz and Nexulan of blackmail. we don't know when this was as it wasn't publicly stated until later. This will be pointed out when the evadance of this comes to light from Karel's own mouth. Some time in 12/xx/2021 Karel fired Nexulan with out talking to the rest of the team this was hidden by most of the team my speculation is they just ignored that Nex was fired and knew talking about it would also start a war in the community as Nex is a major influencer in the community and was even the community manager before moved to producer.

    Yeah, because having one full time engineer that does things like transplanting entire physics engines in ~1 month's time is "slow" while the rest of us use what free time we have due to other jobs adds things over the weekend from time to time. Like a color management pipeline.
