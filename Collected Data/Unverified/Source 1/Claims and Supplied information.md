Source 1 claims the following:
- Dev teams are not giving out enough information for the community to help.
 - To elaborate on this most information publically available comes from Karel himself (Most of the information on how things are going I've gotten from Karel's own mouth and well... they clearly treat the dev team and Froox rather horridly.) [No Evidance, Explination of the Following]

 - karel has Claims of the dev team blackmailing them while having the story of "how" going all over the place. using the fact that the dev team is furry to toss "creative" insults their way.
  Accusatiosn of Blackmail "https://twitter.com/KarelHulec/status/1538427836456894465" "https://twitter.com/KarelHulec/status/1509092477990494209"] [Creative insults "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/947875485529047050/988807324011466855/unknown.png"]

 - Karel wants the team to use real names rather than their personas. ["https://twitter.com/KarelHulec/status/1509152615686414341" and "https://twitter.com/KarelHulec/status/1509135778156367878"]

- karel has given way to much information on the way Froox use to live... and heavily hinting on wanting to fire every last one of the devs that worked on this project.) ["https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srv51s"]

- People use NCR as fuel for anti/pro crypto campaigns(NCR isn't really the issue at hand with the dev team. although it was the catalyst for a lot of the issues a lot of people use the NCR as a focus to try and run with their own anti-crypto (or pro-crypto ideals)) [No Evidance, Speculation]

- Informs us that the company is owned 42.5%/42.5% with 15% owned by Rothenberg Ventures, The 15% bit they have to manually claim however Rothenberg Ventures was disolved due to legal issues and is currently at a stalemate of ownership/decision. Most just refer to this as 50/50 ownership as that is effectively what it is and is easier than the full thing.

- The decisions of Karel have been detrimental to the project and go against the dev teams advice((every part that Karel was in control of has actually had massive massive issues and has slowed down a lot of development from what I've gathered from the dev team....) [single recent example of this: "https://discord.com/channels/402159838827905024/735381514988159016/1010153704558702642"]

- That alof of controll is by another[An alias given of the dev team to Karel](a lot of comments from the dev team on some problems was "That is controlled by `another` so we have to go through them" it wasn't until after this dispute and it was reveled what was under Karels control that I realized every time they said `another` they meant Karel rather than a third party (primarily involving features related to the website, other payment services, and working with other businesses).) [No Evidance, Mostly Verbal Communication]

- Dev team seems to be willing to accept help for Continuing their work on Neos but only if Karel is not in ownership of it, They refuse to work with Karel, Crypto/NCR is not part of their requirements(Now it comes to the issue of what to do in this regard, the dev team seems willing to accept almost anything that does the following things: - Continuing work on Neos, even if only as a concept. Which Karel would not own. - Not working with Karel [https://discord.com/channels/402159838827905024/941727532779200593/992671098279821312](https://discord.com/channels/402159838827905024/941727532779200593/992671098279821312 "https://discord.com/channels/402159838827905024/941727532779200593/992671098279821312") (link to reference to the above requirements) Note anything to do with NCR/Crypto is not part of those requirements.)

- Karel refuses to let go of the NeosVR Project in amy shape or form claiming 50/50 ownership( But it seems Karel does not want to let Neos go in any form or is requiring the dev team to work with them on/with something as such this is mostly at a stand still seeing as the company is still owned 50/50. ) [No Evidance, Speculation]

- Noone who worked on the code was payed by Karel who was in control of the payments(Oh and I'd also like to note none of the dev team was paid either as Karel was in charge of the pay. (some of the team was paid jut no one who worked on code).) [No pay to devlopers as stated by the team "https://discord.com/channels/402159838827905024/439421931830378506/942215313951445062"]

- A thread about Karel's posts on twitter [https://discord.com/channels/402159838827905024/947875485529047050/988812835490529280](https://discord.com/channels/402159838827905024/947875485529047050/988812835490529280 "https://discord.com/channels/402159838827905024/947875485529047050/988812835490529280")

- As protest the devs have ceasesd releasing any form of update to the platform with the exception of security updates untill the current issue is resolved(that's what they are doing currently. they have stoped releasing any updates to the platform (other than security fixes) until this gets resolved. (edited)) [Evidance is primarally lack of Updates]
